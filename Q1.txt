To activate and deactivate a purely resistive load, i'd use PWM
techniques  for power modulation. If is avalible an microcontroler with and
peripheral PWM, it would be better, since you don't need to use CPU power to control it.

For and inductive load, it's necessary to add an proporcional capacitor, to prevent overvontage
due the high dV/dt on inductor. It will be acting as an filter, like the ones found on
an DC DC swithcing converter.
